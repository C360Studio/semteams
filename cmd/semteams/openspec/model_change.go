// field (unlike Spec/Delta in model.go/model_delta.go). Their lenient-ingest
// drops are minor and round-trip stably — stray "## Scope" prose, a misplaced
// "### Decision:" body, trailing text after a file-change "(kind)", a
// non-checkbox task bullet — and authored output is gated by create_change's
// emit_change tool (ADR-057 §D3), not by ingest.

// Proposal is a change's proposal.md (ADR-057 §D1 change.<slug>.proposal.*):
// the "why" and shape of a change, before specs/design/tasks.
