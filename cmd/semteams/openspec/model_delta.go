// Delta is a change's delta spec for one capability — the content of
// changes/<slug>/specs/<capability>/spec.md. It groups requirement changes by
// operation (ADR-057 §D1 change.<slug>.delta.<cap>.<rid>.{op,...}). The three
// slices map to OpenSpec's "## ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED Requirements"
// sections; render always emits them in that canonical order, so the round-trip
// is stable regardless of the input's section ordering.
