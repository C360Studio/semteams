# E2E Test Review Summary

**Review Date**: 2025-12-20  
**Scenarios Reviewed**: 8  
**Overall Assessment**: Moderate Coverage with Critical Gaps

---

## Executive Summary

The SemStreams e2e test suite provides **foundation-level validation** of core functionality but has **significant gaps** in testing the flagship features: PathRAG and GraphRAG query patterns. Most scenarios verify that systems are running but don't adequately validate correctness of results.

### Key Findings

| Category | Status | Summary |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Core Infrastructure | **Good** | Health, components, and basic dataflow validated |
| Data Pipeline | **Moderate** | Messages flow but content not verified |
| Rules Engine | **Good** | State transitions and metrics validated |
| Index Population | **Good** | All 7 indexes verified populated |
| Search Functionality | **Moderate** | Queries execute but results weakly validated |
| **RAG Patterns** | **Critical Gap** | PathRAG and GraphRAG not tested |
| Gateway APIs | **Weak** | Queries execute but schema/results not validated |
| Error Handling | **Weak** | Tests often pass regardless of behavior |

---

## Critical Gaps

### 1. PathRAG Not Tested (Tier 0 Feature)

**Impact**: High  
**Affected Tiers**: All (Structural, Statistical, Semantic)

PathRAG is documented as a core Tier 0 feature for structural graph traversal, but **no e2e test exists**:

- Bounded DFS traversal untested
- Decay-factor scoring untested
- Predicate filtering untested
- Direction control (incoming/outgoing/both) untested
- Resource bounds (max_depth, max_nodes, max_time) untested

**Documentation**: `docs/concepts/08-pathrag-pattern.md`

### 2. GraphRAG Not Tested (Tier 1+ Feature)

**Impact**: High  
**Affected Tiers**: Statistical, Semantic

GraphRAG is the flagship community-based search feature, but **no e2e test exists**:

- Local search (entity → community context) untested
- Global search (topic → communities) untested
- LLM answer generation (Tier 2) untested
- Community context assembly untested

**Documentation**: `docs/concepts/07-graphrag-pattern.md`

### 3. Spatial/Temporal Index Queries Not Tested

**Impact**: Medium  
**Affected Tiers**: All

Both indexes are populated and verified, but actual queries are not tested:

- Spatial bounding box queries execute but may return wrong results
- Temporal range queries execute but may return wrong results
- GraphQL gateway tests only count results, don't verify correctness

## Scenario-by-Scenario Summary

| Scenario | Status | Key Issues |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **core-health** | Good | Minor: `MaxStartupTime` unused |
| **core-dataflow** | Moderate | Filter logic not validated; content not verified |
| **core-federation** | Weak | `MinMessagesOnCloud` unused; federation not actually verified |
| **tiered-structural** | Good | **PathRAG not tested**; zero-constraints are warnings only |
| **tiered-statistical** | Moderate | **GraphRAG not tested**; community structure not validated |
| **tiered-semantic** | Good LLM | **GraphRAG not tested**; LLM quality not validated |
| **gateway-graphql** | Weak | Schema not validated; hardcoded IDs don't match test data |
| **gateway-mcp** | Very Weak | Rate limiting/error handling tests always pass |

---

## Priority Matrix

### Critical (Must Fix)

| Issue | Scenarios | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| No PathRAG test | All tiered | Create `test-pathrag` stage with known entity traversal |
| No GraphRAG test | Statistical, Semantic | Create `test-graphrag-local` and `test-graphrag-global` stages |
| Federation not verified | core-federation | Implement `MinMessagesOnCloud` check |
| MCP tests always pass | gateway-mcp | Fix rate limiting and error handling assertions |

### High (Should Fix)

| Issue | Scenarios | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| GraphQL schema not validated | gateway-graphql | Add response schema validation |
| Zero-constraints are warnings | tiered-structural | Make hard failures |
| Entity IDs don't match test data | gateway-graphql | Use IDs from test data files |
| Search quality thresholds low | tiered-statistical | Raise min_score from 0.3 to 0.5 |
| Community structure not validated | tiered-statistical | Query and validate COMMUNITY_INDEX |

### Medium (Should Fix)

| Issue | Scenarios | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Filter logic not validated | core-dataflow | Verify filter condition works |
| Rule graph modifications not verified | tiered-structural | Check indexes after rules fire |
| Spatial/temporal queries not validated | tiered-* | Add content validation for results |
| LLM summary quality not validated | tiered-semantic | Check summary length, coherence |

### Low (Nice to Have)

| Issue | Scenarios | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `MaxStartupTime` unused | core-health | Remove or implement |
| Pagination not tested | gateway-graphql | Add limit/offset tests |
| Community hierarchy not tested | tiered-* | Test levels 0, 1, 2 |

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 weeks)

1. **Create PathRAG e2e test**
   - Pick known entity from test data
   - Execute PathRAG query via GraphQL
   - Validate connected entities returned
   - Check decay scores decrease with depth

2. **Create GraphRAG e2e tests**
   - Local search: entity → community context
   - Global search: topic → communities
   - Validate community summaries in response

3. **Fix federation test**
   - Implement `MinMessagesOnCloud` validation
   - Verify messages actually arrive on cloud

4. **Fix MCP gateway tests**
   - Make rate limiting test actually assert
   - Make error handling test actually assert

### Phase 2: High Priority Fixes (2-3 weeks)

5. **Validate GraphQL response schema**
   - Add type checks for entity, relationship, search results
   - Use entity IDs from actual test data

6. **Make zero-constraints hard failures**
   - Structural tier should fail on any embeddings/clusters

7. **Validate community structure**
   - Query COMMUNITY_INDEX
   - Verify non-singleton communities exist
   - Check summaries have keywords

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Fixes (Ongoing)

8. Validate filter logic in core-dataflow
9. Verify rule graph modifications in indexes
10. Add content validation for spatial/temporal queries
11. Validate LLM summary quality

## Conclusion

The e2e test suite successfully validates that SemStreams **boots and runs** but does not adequately validate that it **works correctly**. The most significant gaps are:

1. **PathRAG (Tier 0)** - No test exists for the core graph traversal feature
2. **GraphRAG (Tier 1+)** - No test exists for the flagship semantic search feature
3. **Result validation** - Most tests count results without verifying content
4. **Always-pass tests** - Several tests never fail regardless of behavior

Addressing the critical gaps should be prioritized to ensure the documented features actually work as specified.
