# Architecture

SemStreams processes event streams into a semantic knowledge graph stored in NATS KV buckets. This document explains the core components and data flow.

## System Overview

SemStreams uses a distributed component architecture where specialized processors watch and react to entity changes
in NATS KV buckets:

## Components

SemStreams uses a component-based architecture. Components are self-describing units that connect via NATS.

### General Component Types

| Type | Examples | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| Input | UDP, WebSocket, File | Ingest data from external sources |
| Processor | Graph, JSONMap, Rule | Transform and enrich data |
| Output | File, HTTPPost, WebSocket | Export data to external systems |
| Storage | ObjectStore | Persist data to NATS JetStream |
| Gateway | HTTP, GraphQL, MCP | Expose APIs for queries and mutations |

### Graph Processing Components

The graph system decomposes into 8 specialized components with clear responsibilities:

| Component | Purpose | Writes To | Watches |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **graph-ingest** | Entity ingestion from event streams | ENTITY_STATES, CONTEXT_INDEX | - |
| **graph-index** | Relationship indexing | OUTGOING_INDEX, INCOMING_INDEX, ALIAS_INDEX, PREDICATE_INDEX | ENTITY_STATES |
| **graph-query** | Query coordinator, PathRAG | - | - (request/reply) |
| **graph-clustering** | Community detection, structural analysis, anomaly detection | COMMUNITY_INDEX, STRUCTURAL_INDEX, ANOMALY_INDEX | ENTITY_STATES |
| **graph-embedding** | Vector embeddings (BM25 or HTTP) | EMBEDDING_INDEX, EMBEDDINGS_CACHE | ENTITY_STATES |
| **graph-index-spatial** | Geospatial indexing (geohash) | SPATIAL_INDEX | ENTITY_STATES |
| **graph-index-temporal** | Time-based indexing | TEMPORAL_INDEX | ENTITY_STATES |
| **graph-gateway** | HTTP/GraphQL/MCP query API | - | All indexes (reads only) |

Each component owns exactly one set of output buckets and watches specific input buckets, enabling independent
scaling and clear data ownership. See [Graph Components Reference](../advanced/07-graph-components.md) for
detailed configuration and deployment information.

### GraphQL Access Patterns

SemStreams provides two GraphQL approaches:

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Generic** | Built-in executor returning `Entity` with triples | AI agents, MCP, exploration |
| **Domain** | Generated type-safe resolvers via `domain-graphql-generator` | Production apps, third-party APIs |

The generic executor works immediately with any domain—no configuration needed. For production applications requiring compile-time type safety, see [Domain-Specific GraphQL](../advanced/04-domain-graphql.md).

> **Note:** GraphQL schemas (`.graphql` files for API types) are unrelated to Component Schemas (struct tags for config validation). See [domain-graphql-generator](../../cmd/domain-graphql-generator/README.md#schema-concepts) for details.

### Flow-Based Design

Components connect through NATS subjects and KV bucket watches rather than direct calls:

- **Loose coupling**: Components react to bucket changes via watchers—no direct dependencies
- **Hook points**: Add components at any point by watching existing buckets or subjects
- **Configuration-driven**: Flows are JSON configs declaring which components to use and how to connect them
- **Single ownership**: Each KV bucket has exactly one writer component, preventing races

The graph processing components work together to build a semantic knowledge graph, but you can build simpler flows
with just protocol-layer components (UDP → JSONMap → File) or add semantic processing with the graph suite.

## Processing Flow

The component-based architecture processes entities through multiple stages. The `graph-query` component serves as
the query coordination layer, providing unified access to all graph component queries through a request/reply pattern.
It orchestrates PathRAG queries and coordinates with graph-index, graph-clustering, and
graph-embedding to compose complex query responses.

### 1. Message Arrival

Messages arrive via NATS JetStream on the `entity.>` subject. Each message contains a payload implementing the
`Graphable` interface:

```go
type Graphable interface {
    EntityID() string      // 6-part federated identifier
    Triples() []Triple     // Facts about this entity
}
```

Your domain processor transforms raw data into this format—this is where domain knowledge lives.

### 2. Entity Ingestion (graph-ingest)

The `graph-ingest` component:

- Consumes messages from the `entity.>` JetStream subject
- Validates entity IDs against the 6-part format
- Optionally infers hierarchical relationships (if `enable_hierarchy: true`)
- Stores entities in `ENTITY_STATES` with version tracking

Example entity state:

```json
{
  "id": "acme.logistics.environmental.sensor.temperature.sensor-042",
  "triples": [
    {"predicate": "sensor.measurement.celsius", "object": 23.5},
    {"predicate": "geo.location.zone", "object": "acme.logistics.facility.zone.area.warehouse-7"}
  ],
  "version": 5
}
```

Updates use compare-and-swap with version numbers (optimistic concurrency).

### 3. Relationship Indexing (graph-index)

The `graph-index` component watches `ENTITY_STATES` and maintains relationship indexes:

| Index | Question Answered | Updated By |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| `OUTGOING_INDEX` | "What does this entity reference?" | graph-index |
| `INCOMING_INDEX` | "Who references this entity?" | graph-index |
| `PREDICATE_INDEX` | "All entities with this property" | graph-index |
| `ALIAS_INDEX` | "Resolve friendly name to entity ID" | graph-index |

Indexes update asynchronously after entity saves. There's a brief window (milliseconds) where an entity exists but
isn't fully indexed.

### 4. Specialized Indexing (Optional)

Additional indexing components run independently:

| Index | Question Answered | Updated By | Input |
|-------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| `SPATIAL_INDEX` | "Entities near this location" | graph-index-spatial | ENTITY_STATES |
| `TEMPORAL_INDEX` | "Entities in this time range" | graph-index-temporal | ENTITY_STATES |

These components watch `ENTITY_STATES` and maintain their indexes in parallel with relationship indexing.

### 5. Rules Evaluation

Stateful rules evaluate conditions against entity state:

```json
{
  "id": "battery-low-alert",
  "expression": "drone.telemetry.battery < 20",
  "on_enter": [
    {"action": "add_triple", "predicate": "alert.status", "object": "battery_low"},
    {"action": "publish", "subject": "alerts.battery"}
  ],
  "on_exit": [
    {"action": "remove_triple", "predicate": "alert.status"}
  ]
}
```

Rules can add/remove triples and publish messages, creating derived facts dynamically.

### 6. Structural Analysis and Anomaly Detection (graph-clustering)

The `graph-clustering` component optionally performs structural analysis after community detection:

- **K-core decomposition**: Identifies the dense backbone of the graph. Each entity gets a core number indicating
  how central and well-connected it is. Higher core = more central.
- **Pivot-based distances**: Pre-computes distances to landmark nodes for O(1) distance estimation between any two
  entities.
- **Anomaly detection**: Detects core isolation and semantic gaps within community contexts.

These computations run after each community detection cycle and store results in `STRUCTURAL_INDEX` and `ANOMALY_INDEX`.

Structural analysis enables:

- Filtering noise (exclude peripheral entities from search results)
- Path query optimization (prune unreachable candidates early)
- Anomaly detection (core demotion, isolation detection, semantic gaps)

Structural analysis requires only NATS—no external services. Semantic gap detection optionally queries graph-embedding.

### 7. Community Detection (graph-clustering)

The `graph-clustering` component watches `ENTITY_STATES` and groups entities into communities using the Label
Propagation Algorithm (LPA). Detection runs:

- After a threshold of entity changes (e.g., 100)
- At configured intervals (e.g., 30s)

Communities are stored in `COMMUNITY_INDEX` and enable GraphRAG-style queries at different granularity levels.

### 8. Embedding Generation (graph-embedding)

The `graph-embedding` component watches `ENTITY_STATES` and generates vector embeddings for semantic similarity:

- **BM25 embedder**: Statistical text similarity (384 dimensions, no external dependencies)
- **HTTP embedder**: Neural embeddings via external service (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Embeddings are stored in `EMBEDDING_INDEX` with caching in `EMBEDDINGS_CACHE`. This enables semantic search and
detection of semantic-structural gaps (entities that are semantically similar but lack graph connections).

## State: NATS KV Buckets

All state lives in NATS JetStream KV buckets. Each bucket has exactly one writer component to prevent races.

**Core buckets** (required for basic graph operations):

| Bucket | Writer Component | Contents |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| `ENTITY_STATES` | graph-ingest | Entity records with triples and version |
| `OUTGOING_INDEX` | graph-index | Entity ID → referenced entities |
| `INCOMING_INDEX` | graph-index | Entity ID → referencing entities |
| `PREDICATE_INDEX` | graph-index | Predicate → entity IDs |
| `ALIAS_INDEX` | graph-index | Alias → entity ID |
| `CONTEXT_INDEX` | graph-ingest | Context/provenance for hierarchy inference |

**Optional buckets** (created when specific components are deployed):

| Bucket | Writer Component | Contents | Required For |
|--------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| `SPATIAL_INDEX` | graph-index-spatial | Geohash → entity IDs | Location queries |
| `TEMPORAL_INDEX` | graph-index-temporal | Time bucket → entity IDs | Time-range queries |
| `COMMUNITY_INDEX` | graph-clustering | Community records with members | Community detection |
| `STRUCTURAL_INDEX` | graph-clustering | K-core levels and pivot distances | Structural analysis |
| `ANOMALY_INDEX` | graph-clustering | Anomaly detection results | Anomaly detection |
| `EMBEDDING_INDEX` | graph-embedding | Entity ID → embedding vector | Semantic similarity |
| `EMBEDDINGS_CACHE` | graph-embedding | Cached entity embeddings | Embedding performance |
| `EMBEDDING_DEDUP` | graph-embedding | Deduplication tracking | Embedding efficiency |

See [Graph Components Reference](../advanced/07-graph-components.md#kv-bucket-ownership-table) for complete
ownership details and reader/writer relationships.

## Data Flow Example

A sensor reading flows through the component architecture:

```text
JetStream    graph-ingest   ENTITY_STATES   graph-index   Index Buckets   gateway
    │             │              │               │              │            │
    ├─ entity ───►│              │               │              │            │

    │             │              ├─ watch ──────►│              │            │
    │             │              │               ├─ update ────►│            │
    │             │              │               │              │            │
    │             │              │               │              ├── reads ──►│
    │             │              │               │              │            │
```

> See [Full Diagram](../diagrams/data-flow-sequence.mmd) for complete sequence.

Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Message arrives**: JetStream receives entity message on `entity.sensor.temperature`
2. **graph-ingest**: Transforms message into EntityState, validates ID format
3. **ENTITY_STATES**: Entity stored with version 6 (optimistic concurrency)
4. **graph-index**: Watches ENTITY_STATES, extracts triples, updates relationship indexes
5. **graph-clustering**: Watches ENTITY_STATES, performs community detection and structural analysis
6. **graph-gateway**: Reads from all buckets to compose query responses

All components operate asynchronously—entity queries return immediately, while index updates complete within
milliseconds.

## Consistency Model

Different components provide different consistency guarantees based on their processing model:

| Component | Consistency Level | Latency |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| graph-ingest (ENTITY_STATES) | Immediate | <1ms |
| graph-index (relationship indexes) | Eventually consistent | <10ms |
| graph-index-spatial/temporal | Eventually consistent | <10ms |
| graph-clustering (communities, structural, anomalies) | Batch | Configurable (default: 30s) |
| graph-embedding (embeddings) | Eventually consistent | <100ms (BM25), varies (HTTP) |

Queries through `graph-gateway` read current bucket state, so they may see entities before their indexes are
complete. This trade-off prioritizes write throughput and component independence.

## Component Deployment Patterns

The component architecture supports flexible deployment strategies:

### Minimal Deployment (Core Graph Only)

Deploy just the essential components for basic graph operations:

- `graph-ingest` - Entity ingestion
- `graph-index` - Relationship indexing
- `graph-query` - Query coordination (optional, for PathRAG)
- `graph-gateway` - Query API

This provides entity storage, relationship traversal, and GraphQL queries without advanced features. The `graph-query`
component is optional but recommended for advanced query patterns like PathRAG.

### Tiered Deployment

Add components incrementally based on capability requirements:

**Tier 1 (Statistical)**:

- Add `graph-clustering` for community detection with structural analysis and anomaly detection
- Add `graph-embedding` with BM25 for statistical similarity

**Tier 2 (Semantic)**:

- Configure `graph-embedding` with HTTP embedder for neural embeddings
- Enable LLM summarization in `graph-clustering`

### Specialized Deployments

Add optional indexing components based on query patterns:

- `graph-index-spatial` for geolocation queries
- `graph-index-temporal` for time-range queries

See [Configuration](06-configuration.md) for complete deployment examples and [Graph Components
Reference](../advanced/07-graph-components.md) for detailed component specifications.

## What SemStreams Is Not

- **Not a database replacement**: No arbitrary SQL or ACID transactions—but dotted notation with NATS subject/KV
  wildcards provides SQL-like query basics (prefix matching, pattern queries)
- **Hybrid streaming/batch**: Entity updates flow continuously, but analysis components (anomalies, clustering) run
  periodically (configurable intervals)
- **Not a time-series DB**: Use InfluxDB/Prometheus for metrics
- **Not full-text search**: Use Elasticsearch for document search
