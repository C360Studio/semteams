# Similarity Metrics

SemStreams uses similarity metrics for community detection, summary preservation, and keyword extraction. This document explains each metric and how the system applies it.

## Cosine Similarity

Measures the angle between two embedding vectors.

### How It Works

```text
                    B
                   /
                  / θ
                 /
    ────────────A────────────

    cosine(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

Two vectors pointing in similar directions have high cosine similarity, regardless of magnitude.

### Value Interpretation

| Cosine Value | Meaning | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| 0.95-1.0 | Near-identical | Same sentence, minor rephrasing |
| 0.80-0.95 | Highly similar | Same topic, different details |
| 0.60-0.80 | Related | Same domain, different subtopics |
| 0.40-0.60 | Weakly related | Tangential connection |
| 0.0-0.40 | Unrelated | Different domains |
| Negative | Opposite | Rare in practice |

### SemStreams Usage

**Virtual edges in community detection:** Entities with cosine similarity above a configured threshold receive a virtual edge, allowing them to cluster even without explicit relationships. This bridges semantically related entities that lack direct connections in the graph.

The threshold controls community granularity—higher values produce tighter, more focused communities while lower values allow broader groupings. The optimal threshold depends on your embedding model, as different models produce different similarity distributions.

## Jaccard Similarity

Measures set overlap—what proportion of elements are shared.

### How It Works

```text
Set A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set B: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Intersection: {3, 4, 5}     (3 elements)
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (7 elements)

Jaccard = |Intersection| / |Union| = 3/7 ≈ 0.43
```

### Value Interpretation

| Jaccard Value | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| 1.0 | Identical sets |
| 0.8-1.0 | High overlap (few changes) |
| 0.5-0.8 | Moderate overlap |
| 0.2-0.5 | Low overlap (significant changes) |
| 0.0 | No shared elements |

### SemStreams Usage

**Community summary preservation:** When communities are re-detected, Jaccard similarity determines whether to preserve existing summaries. The system compares old and new community membership—if overlap is high, the existing summary remains valid. If membership has changed significantly, a new summary is generated.

This balances summary freshness against LLM cost. Higher thresholds regenerate summaries more often (fresher but more expensive), while lower thresholds preserve summaries longer (cheaper but potentially stale).

## Term Frequency Scoring (Keyword Extraction)

Extracts keywords that characterize a community by finding frequently occurring terms within the community's entities.

### How It Works

```text
For each entity in community:
  1. Extract terms from entity type
  2. Extract terms from property predicates
  3. Extract terms from string property values

Score each term:
  TF = occurrences / total_entities
  Score = TF × log(1 + occurrences)
```

Terms that appear frequently across many entities score highest.

### Example

```text
Community (warehouse sensors, 50 entities):
  "temperature" appears 45 times → Score: 0.90 × log(46) = 3.4
  "sensor" appears 50 times → Score: 1.0 × log(51) = 3.9
  "zone-a" appears 12 times → Score: 0.24 × log(13) = 0.6

Top keywords: ["sensor", "temperature", "zone-a"]
```

### SemStreams Usage

**Statistical community summaries:** Keywords are extracted from entity types and triple properties. Each community summary includes these keywords alongside representative entities.

The system filters common stopwords and short terms. Keyword quality depends on meaningful property values—domain-specific terms in triples produce more distinctive keywords.

## PageRank (Representative Selection)

Identifies hub entities—those with many incoming connections.

### How It Works

PageRank scores entities by the importance of entities linking to them:

```text
Entity A ◄── B, C, D         (3 incoming)
Entity E ◄── A               (1 incoming, but from important A)
Entity F ◄── G               (1 incoming from unimportant G)

PageRank: A > E > F (approximately)
```

### SemStreams Usage

**Selecting representative entities for community summaries:** Representatives are high-PageRank entities within the community—the hub nodes with many connections. These appear in community summaries and provide anchors for understanding the community's structure.

The number of representatives per community is configurable. More representatives provide richer context for LLM-generated summaries but increase prompt size.

## Metric Interactions

These metrics work together:
