# Flow Architecture

SemStreams supports two operational modes that share a unified Flow abstraction. Understanding how these modes work helps you choose the right approach for your deployment.

## Operation Modes

### Headless Mode (Static Config)

Start SemStreams with a JSON/YAML config file. Components load and run automatically:

```bash
semstreams --config config.json
```

- No UI required
- Components start on boot
- Ideal for production deployments, CI/CD pipelines
- Config changes require restart (or use KV override)

### UI Mode (Visual Flow Builder)

Design and manage flows through a visual interface:

- Drag-and-drop component placement
- Visual connection of ports
- Real-time deploy/start/stop control
- Live metrics and health monitoring

Both modes use the same underlying Flow abstraction, enabling seamless transitions.

## Two KV Buckets

SemStreams persists state in two NATS JetStream KV buckets:

| Bucket | Contents | Used By |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `semstreams_config` | Component configs, service configs | ComponentManager (runtime) |
| `semstreams_flows` | Visual flow definitions (canvas layout) | FlowService (UI API) |

The config bucket stores the runtime configuration that the ComponentManager watches and reacts to. The flows bucket stores visual flow definitions that the UI displays and modifies.

## Static Config → Flow Bridge

When you start with a static config file, SemStreams automatically creates a Flow entry in the flows bucket. This bridges the gap between headless and UI modes:

```text
First Boot (static config):
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│ config.json │ ──► │ semstreams_config│ ──► │ ComponentMgr   │
└─────────────┘     │     KV bucket    │     │ (runs them)    │
                    └──────────────────┘     └────────────────┘
                              │
                    ┌─────────▼────────┐
                    │  Auto-converted  │
                    │  to Flow         │
                    └─────────┬────────┘
                              │
                    ┌─────────▼────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
                    │ semstreams_flows │ ◄── │ FlowService    │
                    │     KV bucket    │     │ (UI reads)     │
                    └──────────────────┘     └────────────────┘
```

This automatic conversion happens in the FlowService during startup, making static configs visible to the UI without manual intervention.

## KV Wins Precedence

On subsequent boots, **KV wins** over static config:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| First boot, static config has components | Create flow in KV |
| Subsequent boot, flow exists in KV | Use KV flow (ignore static config) |
| Flow deleted from KV | Re-create from static config |

This precedence pattern:
- Preserves UI customizations across restarts
- Allows "reset" by deleting the flow from KV
- Matches the existing config.Manager behavior

## Flow Lifecycle

Flows progress through defined states:

```text
not_deployed → deployed_stopped → running → deployed_stopped → not_deployed
                     ↓                            ↑
                   error ─────────────────────────┘
```

| State | Description | Available Actions |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `not_deployed` | Design phase, not in runtime | Deploy |
| `deployed_stopped` | Pushed to config KV, not running | Start, Undeploy |
| `running` | Components actively processing | Stop |
| `error` | Deployment or runtime failure | Fix and redeploy |

Static configs start in `running` state since components are already active at startup.

## Flow Engine Operations

The FlowEngine handles lifecycle transitions:

### Deploy

Converts Flow → ComponentConfigs and pushes to config KV bucket:
1. Validate flow structure and connections
2. Build FlowGraph for port analysis
3. Convert nodes to ComponentConfigs
4. Persist to `semstreams_config` bucket
5. ComponentManager watches and creates components

### Start

Enables components and begins processing:
1. Update component `enabled` flags in config KV
2. ComponentManager reacts and starts components
3. Data begins flowing through the pipeline

### Stop

Pauses processing while preserving deployment:
1. Disable components in config KV
2. ComponentManager stops components gracefully
3. State preserved for restart

### Undeploy

Removes components from runtime:
1. Delete component configs from config KV
2. ComponentManager removes components
3. Flow returns to `not_deployed` state

## Visual Flow Concepts

### Nodes

Each FlowNode represents a component instance:

```json
{
  "id": "udp-input",
  "type": "udp",
  "name": "UDP Input",
  "position": {"x": 100, "y": 50},
  "config": {"port": 14550}
}
```

- `id`: Unique instance identifier
- `type`: Component factory name (e.g., "udp", "graph-processor")
- `position`: Canvas coordinates for UI layout
- `config`: Component-specific configuration

### Connections

FlowConnections define data paths between component ports:

```json
{
  "id": "conn-1",
  "source_node_id": "udp-input",
  "source_port": "data",
  "target_node_id": "processor",
  "target_port": "input"
}
```

At deployment, connections are validated against component port definitions.

### Automatic Layout

When converting static configs to flows, nodes receive automatic grid positions. Users can rearrange nodes in the UI as needed.

## When to Use Each Mode

| Use Case | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Production deployment | Headless (static config) |
| Development/debugging | UI mode |
| CI/CD pipelines | Headless (static config) |
| New flow design | UI mode |
| Operational monitoring | UI mode |

You can start in headless mode for initial deployment, then connect the UI later to monitor and adjust the running flow.
